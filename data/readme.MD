This folder contains data that are used for replication.

- *./* -- scripts to convert source data (from data_src or from the web) to pickles; variable selection and categorization takes place here
- *./data_src* -- source data (typically in csv format)
- *./data_pkl* -- data pickles (saved pandas dataframes to quickly load the data
